                    University Extension came to life in 1891 when three professors crossed the Bay by ferry to offer
                    courses in San Francisco in history (Prof. Bacon), mathematics (Prof. Stringham) and English
                    literature (Prof. Gayley) 2 . These long awaited education opportunities were met with much
                    enthusiasm by the people of San Francisco, more than 800 people attended the first classes.
                    However, following the official approval of Extension by the Academic Senate in 1892, a financial
                    crisis hit the university and in 1893 the faculty was no longer able to provide courses to the public
                    without being offered any compensation.</p>

                    <p class="decade-text col-3">In 1902, the Board of Regents made University Extension an autonomous department under the
                        leadership of the former Cornell history professor Henry Morse Stephens. Stephens was a fervent
                        supporter of the original ideology of university extension’s: “I am longing to try my hand on a great
                        Extension scheme on the Oxford line - I know I can do it and make a success of it.” In contrast to the
                        initial ‘free lectures’ model of Gayley and his colleagues, Stephens designed and organized lectures
                        to meet the needs and interests of adult professionals across the state. This model was operating
                        largely independently of the Academic Senate, used mainly non-faculty lecturers offering non-credit
                        courses, and was self-funded through a subscription model. With this extremely agile and
                        student-centric model, he created the fundamental concept of Continuing Education as we know it
                        today. The success of this model and his own energy, engagement and popularity, allowed
                        corresExtension to grow exponentially, reaching its peak of 15 centers around the state of California
                        in 1905. However, when Stephens continued his career with other university appointments after
                        1905, Extension activities declined until they ultimately ceased in 1910.</p>
